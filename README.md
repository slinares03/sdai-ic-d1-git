## ToDo list ✅
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.
1. [X] Create an `index.html` file.
2. [X ] In line 1, type an exclamation point, wait to see the prompt, then hit `enter`. Run `git status`. Observe the output.
3. [X ] Stage your work with `git add .` Run `git status` once again to see the difference between unstaged work in step 2 and stage work now.
4. [X ] Run `git commit -m "Created index.html"`.
5. [X ] Add a `h1` header with the text "Hello World".
6. [ ] run `git add .` to stage the work, and the commit it using `git commit -m "Added main header"`.
7. [ ] run `git push origin main` to push your work to your repository on github. Refresh the page and you should now see your `index.html` file with your additions on the page.
